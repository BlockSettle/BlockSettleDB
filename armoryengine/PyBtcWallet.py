class PyBtcWallet(object):
   """
   This class encapsulates all the concepts and variables in a "wallet",
   and maintains the passphrase protection, key stretching, encryption,
   etc, required to maintain the wallet.  This class also includes the
   file I/O methods for storing and loading wallets.

   ***NOTE:  I have ONLY implemented deterministic wallets, using ECDSA
             Diffie-Hellman shared-secret crypto operations.  This allows
             one to actually determine the next PUBLIC KEY in the address
             chain without actually having access to the private keys.
             This makes it possible to synchronize online-offline computers
             once and never again.

             You can import random keys into your wallet, but if it is
             encrypted, you will have to supply a passphrase to make sure
             it can be encrypted as well.

   Presumably, wallets will be used for one of three purposes:

   (1) Spend money and receive payments
   (2) Watching-only wallets - have the private keys, just not on this computer
   (3) May be watching *other* people's addrs.  There's a variety of reasons
       we might want to watch other peoples' addresses, but most them are not
       relevant to a "basic" BTC user.  Nonetheless it should be supported to
       watch money without considering it part of our own assets

   This class is included in the combined-python-cpp module, because we really
   need to maintain a persistent Cpp.BtcWallet if this class is to be useful
   (we don't want to have to rescan the entire blockchain every time we do any
   wallet operations).

   The file format was designed from the outset with lots of unused space to
   allow for expansion without having to redefine the file format and break
   previous wallets.  Luckily, wallet information is cheap, so we don't have
   to stress too much about saving space (100,000 addresses should take 15 MB)

   This file is NOT for storing Tx-related information.  I want this file to
   be the minimal amount of information you need to secure and backup your
   entire wallet.  Tx information can always be recovered from examining the
   blockchain... your private keys cannot be.

   We track version numbers, just in case.  We start with 1.0

   Version 1.0:
   ---
   fileID      -- (8)  '\xbaWALLET\x00' for wallet files
   version     -- (4)   getVersionInt(PYBTCWALLET_VERSION)
   magic bytes -- (4)   defines the blockchain for this wallet (BTC, NMC)
   wlt flags   -- (8)   64 bits/flags representing info about wallet
   binUniqueID -- (6)   first 5 bytes of first address in wallet
                        (rootAddr25Bytes[:5][::-1]), reversed
                        This is not intended to look like the root addr str
                        and is reversed to avoid having all wallet IDs start 
                        with the same characters (since the network byte is front)
   create date -- (8)   unix timestamp of when this wallet was created
                        (actually, the earliest creation date of any addr
                        in this wallet -- in the case of importing addr
                        data).  This is used to improve blockchain searching
   Short Name  -- (32)  Null-terminated user-supplied short name for wlt
   Long Name   -- (256) Null-terminated user-supplied description for wlt
   Highest Used-- (8)   The chain index of the highest used address
   ---
   Crypto/KDF  -- (512) information identifying the types and parameters
                        of encryption used to secure wallet, and key
                        stretching used to secure your passphrase.
                        Includes salt. (the breakdown of this field will
                        be described separately)
   KeyGenerator-- (237) The base address for a determinstic wallet.
                        Just a serialized PyBtcAddress object.
   ---
   UNUSED     -- (1024) unused space for future expansion of wallet file
   ---
   Remainder of file is for key storage and various other things.  Each
   "entry" will start with a 4-byte code identifying the entry type, then
   20 bytes identifying what address the data is for, and finally then
   the subsequent data .  So far, I have three types of entries that can
   be included:

      \x01 -- Address/Key data (as of PyBtcAddress version 1.0, 237 bytes)
      \x02 -- Address comments (variable-width field)
      \x03 -- Address comments (variable-width field)
      \x04 -- OP_EVAL subscript (when this is enabled, in the future)

   Please see PyBtcAddress for information on how key data is serialized.
   Comments (\x02) are var-width, and if a comment is changed to
   something longer than the existing one, we'll just blank out the old
   one and append a new one to the end of the file.  It looks like

   02000000 01 <Addr> 4f This comment is enabled (01) with 4f characters


   For file syncing, we protect against corrupted wallets by doing atomic
   operations before even telling the user that new data has been added.
   We do this by copying the wallet file, and creating a walletUpdateFailed
   file.  We then modify the original, verify its integrity, and then delete
   the walletUpdateFailed file.  Then we create a backupUpdateFailed flag,
   do the identical update on the backup file, and delete the failed flag. 
   This guaranatees that no matter which nanosecond the power goes out,
   there will be an uncorrupted wallet and we know which one it is.

   We never let the user see any data until the atomic write-to-file operation
   has completed


   Additionally, we implement key locking and unlocking, with timeout.  These
   key locking features are only DEFINED here, not actually enforced (because
   this is a library, not an application).  You can set the default/temporary
   time that the KDF key is maintained in memory after the passphrase is
   entered, and this class will keep track of when the wallet should be next
   locked.  It is up to the application to check whether the current time
   exceeds the lock time.  This will probably be done in a kind of heartbeat
   method, which checks every few seconds for all sorts of things -- including
   wallet locking.

      This method will create a new wallet, using as much customizability
      as you want.  You can enable encryption, and set the target params
      of the key-derivation function (compute-time and max memory usage).
      The KDF parameters will be experimentally determined to be as hard
      as possible for your computer within the specified time target
      (default, 0.25s).  It will aim for maximizing memory usage and using
      only 1 or 2 iterations of it, but this can be changed by scaling
      down the kdfMaxMem parameter (default 32 MB).

      If you use encryption, don't forget to supply a 32-byte passphrase,
      created via SecureBinaryData(pythonStr).  This method will apply
      the passphrase so that the wallet is "born" encrypted.

      The field plainRootKey could be used to recover a written backup
      of a wallet, since all addresses are deterministically computed
      from the root address.  This obviously won't reocver any imported
      keys, but does mean that you can recover your ENTIRE WALLET from
      only those 32 plaintext bytes AND the 32-byte chaincode.

      We skip the atomic file operations since we don't even have
